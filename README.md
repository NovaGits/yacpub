YAC Client, the one thats public
================================

Only there for transparency, see license!

You should set the settings a bit harsher, the pub version was, on purpose, made a bit worse than the private one.
DONT ACTIVATE ANY OTHER AUTOTOTEM ALONG THIS ONE, it will glitch it out!

commands:
`,t <module>` where <module> is:
  - autototem
  - tpaparty
`,autototem count <count>` where <count> is any number from 0 to 64, recommended is:
  - if server has stacked tots, 2
  - if server has 32ks and stacked tots, 4-8
  - if server is normal, 0
  
more soon
