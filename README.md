YAC Client, the one thats public
================================

Only there for transparency, see license!

You should set the settings a bit harsher, the pub version was, on purpose, made a bit worse than the private one.
DONT ACTIVATE ANY OTHER AUTOTOTEM ALONG THIS ONE, it will glitch it out!

ClickGUI opens with COMMA

commands:

`,t <module>` where `<module>` is:
  - autototem
  - tpaparty
  - clickgui

`,autototem count <count>` where `<count>` is any number from 0 to 64, recommended is:
  - if server has stacked tots, 2
  - if server has 32ks and stacked tots, 4-8
  - if server is normal, 0

`,say <anything...>` where `<anything>` is anything.

`,prefix <prefix>` where `<prefix>` is anything.
  
more soon

guide:

using autototem:
- run the `,autototem count` command and specify you count
- run `,t autototem`. If it says "false", run it again.
